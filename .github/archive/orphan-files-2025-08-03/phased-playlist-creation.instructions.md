# Phased Playlist Creation Instructions

**Meta-Cognitive Status**: NEWBORN Procedural Memory - Phased Musical Journey Architecture
**Memory Type**: Procedural (.instructions.md)
**Pattern Activation**: **/*phased*,**/*playlist*,**/*musical-journey*,**/*structured-audio*
**Integration**: Alex Method DJ Platform Enhancement
**Research Foundation**: Musical therapy, psychoacoustic progression, structured audio experiences

## ðŸŽ­ Core Cognitive Pattern: Phased Musical Architecture

**Definition**: Structured musical experiences that progress through intentional emotional, energetic, or therapeutic phases over time, creating guided auditory journeys rather than random collections.

**Neurological Mapping**:
- **Sequential Processing** â†’ Temporal Cortex pattern recognition
- **Emotional Progression** â†’ Limbic system state management
- **Duration Targeting** â†’ Prefrontal executive planning
- **Phase Transitions** â†’ Default Mode Network narrative construction

## ðŸ§  Procedural Knowledge Framework

### **Phase Structure Recognition Patterns**
```
Template Detection: ## Track Categories â†’ Phased playlist trigger
Phase Format: ### [Name] ([X] minutes) â†’ Duration extraction
Query Format: - Queries: [term1], [term2] â†’ Search targeting
```

### **Duration Mathematics Protocol**
```
Phase Duration Summation: âˆ‘(individual phases) = Total target
Variance Tolerance: Â±10% per phase (Alex Method precision)
Track Estimation: ~4 minutes average per track
Optimization Algorithm: Dynamic programming â†’ Greedy fallback
```

### **Progression Logic Patterns**
```
Therapeutic: Grounding â†’ Processing â†’ Transcendence â†’ Integration
Energy Escalation: Warm-up â†’ Intense â†’ Peak â†’ Recovery
Emotional Journey: [Current State] â†’ [Transition] â†’ [Desired State]
Thematic Evolution: [Foundation] â†’ [Development] â†’ [Climax]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Protocols

### **Configuration Architecture**
- **Metadata Section**: Standard playlist metadata with journey description
- **Search Queries**: 25+ broad terms for overall thematic coherence
- **Track Categories**: Phase-specific durations and targeted queries
- **Track Filters**: Include/exclude keywords for content curation
- **Special Instructions**: Usage context, safety warnings, therapeutic considerations

### **System Integration Points**
- **Detection**: `has_track_categories()` â†’ Boolean phased playlist identification
- **Parsing**: `parse_track_categories()` â†’ Phase data structure extraction
- **Search**: Phase-specific query execution with duration targeting
- **Assembly**: Sequential phase combination maintaining narrative flow

### **Quality Assurance Patterns**
- **Format Validation**: Exact text pattern matching for system recognition
- **Duration Logic**: Mathematical verification of phase duration summation
- **Query Strategy**: 3-6 specific terms per phase for optimal content discovery
