# Playlist Configuration Templates

## Universal Template

Use `TEMPLATE-universal.md` as the base for all new playlists.

### Template Features
- **Single Phase**: Use one "Main Phase" for simple playlists
- **Multi Phase**: Create progression phases for complex playlists (e.g., warm-up → main → cool-down)
- **Duration Control**: Each phase has specific duration targeting
- **Advanced Search**: Phase-specific search queries for better results

### Examples
- **Single Phase**: `coffee-shop.md` - One "Coffeehouse Vibes" phase
- **Multi Phase**: `study-focus.md` - Four phases (Gentle Start → Deep Focus → Active Concentration → Wind Down)
- **Therapeutic**: `ketamine-therapy.md` - Journey phases for therapy sessions

### Why Universal Template?
- Works for both simple and complex playlists
- Better duration control and content targeting
- Consistent format across all configurations
- Enhanced search capabilities with phase-specific queries

The universal template automatically detects single vs. multi-phase configurations and optimizes accordingly.
