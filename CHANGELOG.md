## üß™ IUPAC Version Naming Convention

### **Systematic Chemical Element Naming Strategy**
Alex Method DJ uses a systematic naming convention based on IUPAC rules for hypothetical chemical elements, providing unique, memorable, and scientifically-inspired names for each version.

### **Naming Rules**
1. **Convert each digit** of the version number into a Latin/Greek root:
   - 0 = "nil" | 1 = "un" | 2 = "bi" | 3 = "tri" | 4 = "quad"
   - 5 = "pent" | 6 = "hex" | 7 = "sept" | 8 = "oct" | 9 = "enn"

2. **Concatenate the roots** in digit order and append "ium"
3. **Remove duplicate vowels** at root boundaries
4. **Drop final "i"** if the last root ends in "i" and is followed by "ium"

### **Current Version Mapping**
- **Version 0.6.1** ‚Üí **NILHEXUNIUM** (Previous - Alex Method DJ Branding)
- **Version 0.6.2** ‚Üí **NILHEXBIUM** (Current - Phased Playlist Architecture)
- **Version 0.7.0** ‚Üí **NILSEPTNILIUM** (Next Target - Advanced Features)

### **Element Breakdown Examples**
- **0.6.1 NILHEXUNIUM**: nil-hex-un-ium (0-6-1)
- **0.6.2 NILHEXBIUM**: nil-hex-bi-ium (0-6-2)
- **1.0.0 UNUNNILIUM**: un-un-nil-ium (1-0-0)
