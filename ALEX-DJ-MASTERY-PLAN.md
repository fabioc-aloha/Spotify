1. **Pre-Analysis**: Score each track on 10 musical dimensions
2. **Pattern Mapping**: Identify structural DNA for mix points
3. **Energy Architecture**: Design complete emotional journey
4. **Harmonic Planning**: Map key changes for maximum impact
5. **Rhythmic Layering**: Plan percussion interactions
