## ðŸ“‹ SEARCH STRATEGY GUIDELINES

**PRINCIPLE**: Use direct, authentic search terms that reflect the true purpose and intent of your playlist, whatever that may be.

- **DESCRIPTION FIELD**: Write a compelling, meaningful description under 300 characters that naturally incorporates the keywords users would search for. Be concise but include searchable terms organically within well-written sentences.
- **SEARCH TERMS**: Use whatever terms best capture the actual intent - therapeutic, entertainment, functional, emotional, or experiential
- Search for what you actually want - be honest about the playlist's purpose
- Examples: "party music", "workout motivation", "anxiety relief ambient", "funny songs", "romantic dinner", "study focus"
- **FOR THERAPEUTIC PLAYLISTS**: Base structure and search terms on established literature and research

## AUTHENTIC SEARCH PHILOSOPHY

**BE TRUE TO YOUR PLAYLIST'S ACTUAL PURPOSE:**

**Therapeutic Playlists** (use research-based approaches):
- "anxiety relief" - evidence-based therapeutic music
- "depression support" - clinically-informed selections
- "trauma healing" - literature-guided structure
- "ADHD focus" - neuroscience-backed musical choices

**Entertainment Playlists** (use what people actually search for):
- "party music" - high-energy, danceable tracks
- "funny songs" - comedic, humorous music
- "throwback hits" - nostalgic, popular tracks
- "feel-good music" - uplifting, positive vibes

**Functional Playlists** (direct purpose-driven):
- "workout motivation" - energizing, driving beats
- "study focus" - concentration-enhancing music
- "dinner party" - sophisticated background music
- "road trip songs" - sing-along favorites

**Emotional Playlists** (honest emotional expression):
- "heartbreak songs" - cathartic, relatable lyrics
- "confidence boost" - empowering, uplifting tracks
- "nostalgic vibes" - memory-triggering classics
- "romantic mood" - intimate, loving atmosphere

**COMBINE WITH MUSICAL DESCRIPTORS** when helpful:
- "party music electronic" - specific genre for party context
- "workout motivation rock" - genre preference for exercise
- "anxiety relief ambient" - therapeutic purpose + calming style
