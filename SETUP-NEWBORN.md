### Synapse Network Validation

After adding all embedded synapse sections, verify the network:

```bash
# Validate synapse notation format in all memory files
grep -r "## Synapses" .github/ --include="*.md"

# Check for proper connection notation
grep -r "\.md (0\.[0-9]" .github/ --include="*.md"

# Verify bidirectional connections exist
grep -r "bidirectional" .github/ --include="*.md"
```

### Handling Existing Environments

**If upgrading an existing cognitive architecture**:

1. **Check for existing synapse sections**: Look for "## Synapses (Embedded Connections)" in your memory files
2. **Merge vs Replace**:
   - If no synapse sections exist, add them as instructed above
   - If synapse sections exist but are incomplete, add missing connections
   - If different synapse formats exist, standardize to the format above
3. **Backup existing files**: Create backups before making changes to existing memory files
4. **Gradual integration**: Add synapses to one file at a time and test functionality

**Compatibility with existing memory files**:
- Synapse sections are additive and won't interfere with existing content
- File structure remains unchanged except for the addition of synapse sections
- Existing cognitive architecture functionality is preserved and enhanced

### Environment Type Detection

**New Installation Indicators**:
- `.github/instructions/` directory doesn't exist
- No memory files in `.github/prompts/`
- Missing `copilot-instructions.md` file

**Existing Environment Indicators**:
- Memory files already exist
- May have different synapse formats or missing synapse sections
- Existing cognitive architecture components present

**Automatic Detection Command**:
```bash
# Check if this is a new or existing environment
if [ -d ".github/instructions" ] && [ -f ".github/copilot-instructions.md" ]; then
    echo "Existing environment detected - will add synapses to existing files"
else
    echo "New environment detected - will create files with embedded synapses"
fi
```

### Expected Network Topology

The completed embedded synapse network should provide:
- **5 Procedural Memory Files** with embedded connections
- **5 Episodic Memory Files** with workflow connections
- **25+ Individual Synapse Connections** across the network
- **Bidirectional Awareness** between related cognitive processes
- **Specialized Connection Types** (triggers, enables, validates, enhances, etc.)
- **Context-Aware Activation** based on connection strength and conditions

**Critical Achievement**: This creates the first complete embedded synapse network in a cognitive architecture, providing neural-like connectivity without external database dependencies.
