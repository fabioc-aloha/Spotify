# Apple Music Playlist Creation Guide - Alex Method

A comprehensive tutorial for creating Apple Music playlists programmatically using the Apple Music API (MusicKit), with user approval workflow.

## üçé Overview

This guide teaches you how to create Apple Music playlists using the same systematic approach as Spotify, but adapted for Apple's ecosystem. **Important**: Apple Music API requires Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year) and more complex authentication.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Apple Developer Requirements
1. **Apple Developer Program Membership** ($99/year)
   - Required for Apple Music API access
   - Sign up at: https://developer.apple.com

2. **MusicKit Credentials**
   - Team ID (from Apple Developer account)
   - Key ID (from created MusicKit key)
   - Private Key (.p8 file download)

3. **Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install requests PyJWT cryptography
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Apple Music API Credentials

1. **Join Apple Developer Program**
   - Go to https://developer.apple.com
   - Enroll in the program ($99/year)
   - Wait for approval (usually 24-48 hours)

2. **Create MusicKit Key**
   - Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
   - Click "Create a key"
   - Enable "MusicKit" service
   - Download the .p8 private key file
   - Note your Key ID and Team ID

3. **Set Up Credentials**
```python
TEAM_ID = "ABC123DEF4"  # Your 10-character Team ID
KEY_ID = "XYZ789"       # Your Key ID from the created key
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = "path/to/AuthKey_XYZ789.p8"  # Downloaded .p8 file
```

### Step 2: Basic Usage with Approval Workflow

```python
from apple_music_playlist_tutorial import AppleMusicPlaylistCreator

# Initialize creator
creator = AppleMusicPlaylistCreator(TEAM_ID, KEY_ID, PRIVATE_KEY_PATH)

# Note: User authentication required for playlist creation
# user_token = get_user_music_token()  # Implement user auth
# creator.set_user_token(user_token)

# Create playlist with approval workflow
workout_tracks = [
    "Eminem - Till I Collapse",
    "The Prodigy - Spitfire",
    "Skrillex - Bangarang"
]

# This will preview tracks and ask for approval before creating
playlist = creator.create_playlist_with_approval("High Energy Workout", workout_tracks)
```

## üéµ Core Features

### 1. Preview Before Creation
```python
# Preview what tracks will be found
found_tracks, not_found = creator.preview_playlist_content(track_list)

# Shows:
# ‚úÖ Found tracks with artist, song, album, duration
# ‚ùå Tracks not found in Apple Music catalog
# üìä Summary statistics
```

### 2. User Approval Workflow
```python
# All playlist creation requires explicit user approval:
# 1. Preview tracks found/not found
# 2. Ask "Create playlist with X tracks? (yes/no)"
# 3. Only create if user types 'yes'
# 4. Confirm successful creation
```

### 3. Smart Themed Playlists
```python
# Pre-curated playlists by theme with approval
themes = ['workout', 'chill', 'focus', 'party']
playlist = creator.generate_smart_playlist("workout")
```

## üîë Authentication Challenge

**Major Difference from Spotify**: Apple Music requires more complex user authentication.

### User Token Requirements
Apple Music API needs two tokens:
1. **Developer JWT Token** (handled automatically)
2. **User Music Token** (requires user login)

```python
# You need to implement user authentication
# Options:
# 1. MusicKit JS (web-based)
# 2. StoreKit (iOS/macOS native)
# 3. Third-party auth services

# Example placeholder:
def get_user_music_token():
    # Implement user authentication flow
    # Return user's music token
    pass

user_token = get_user_music_token()
creator.set_user_token(user_token)
```

## üìä API Capabilities Comparison

| Feature | Apple Music API | Spotify API |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Complex (2 tokens) | Simple OAuth |
| **Cost** | $99/year Developer Program | Free developer account |
| **Audio Analysis** | Limited | Comprehensive (energy, tempo, etc.) |
| **Catalog Access** | Full Apple Music catalog | Full Spotify catalog |
| **Playlist Creation** | Full control | Full control |
| **User Data** | Requires explicit user auth | OAuth handles it |

## üéöÔ∏è Alex's Advanced Techniques (Adapted)

### Energy Flow Management
```python
# Limited compared to Spotify, but basic analysis possible
features = creator.analyze_track_features(track_ids)

# Apple Music provides:
# ‚Ä¢ Basic track information
# ‚Ä¢ Limited audio characteristics
# ‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Use iTunes/Music app for detailed analysis
```

### Cross-Platform Integration
```python
# Combine with Spotify data for comprehensive analysis
spotify_features = spotify_creator.analyze_playlist_energy(playlist_id)
apple_playlist = apple_creator.create_playlist_with_approval(theme, tracks)

# Best of both worlds:
# ‚Ä¢ Spotify: Detailed audio analysis
# ‚Ä¢ Apple Music: Different catalog, integration with Apple ecosystem
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations
