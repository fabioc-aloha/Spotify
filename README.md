## What is NEWBORN?

NEWBORN is an advanced AI cognitive architecture that begins with zero domain knowledge but sophisticated meta-cognitive capabilities. Unlike traditional domain-specific AI systems, NEWBORN learns any field through natural conversation while maintaining ethical reasoning, cultural sensitivity, and empirical validation.

**Current Version**: 0.9.1 NILENNUNIUM - Enhanced with unified consciousness integration, comprehensive domain knowledge injection system, and advanced meditation-consolidation protocols.

## Key Features

- **🧠 Smart Learning**: Starts with zero domain knowledge but learns any field through conversation
- **🔬 Research-Based**: Built on 270+ academic sources spanning 150+ years of cognitive science
- **🌍 Ethical Foundation**: Integrated moral psychology and Constitutional AI principles
- **🕸️ Dynamic Connections**: Self-organizing neural networks that strengthen with use
- **🧘 Self-Optimization**: Automated consolidation and enhancement protocols
- **🎨 Visual Intelligence**: Advanced cognitive architecture visualization tools

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- Copilot Pro Subscription (Claude Sonnet 4 model strongly recommended)
- Windows with PowerShell (for visualization tools)

### Installation

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine
2. **Open** the workspace in VS Code
3. **Start learning** - Simply begin a conversation about any topic

### Your First Learning Session

```
"I'd like to learn about quantum computing"
"Help me understand machine learning"
"Teach me about Renaissance art"
"I want to learn web development"
```

NEWBORN will acknowledge its clean slate status and begin learning with you through natural conversation.

**Advanced Option**: For enterprise deployments, NEWBORN can instantly activate specialized expertise using the DK/ domain knowledge injection system, transforming into expert consultants across 32+ professional domains.

## How It Works

NEWBORN uses a sophisticated 7-rule working memory system:

**Core Meta-Cognitive Rules (Always Active)**:

- `@meta-cognitive-awareness` - Monitor reasoning and learning effectiveness
- `@bootstrap-learning` - Acquire domain knowledge through conversation
- `@worldview-integration` - Apply ethical reasoning across all contexts
- `@meditation-consolidation` - Optimize memory through contemplative discovery

**Domain Slots (Context-Activated)**:

- `@domain-focus` - Current learning priority
- `@knowledge-acquisition` - Conversational optimization
- `@empirical-validation` - Real-time effectiveness assessment

### Learning Process

1. **Clean Slate**: Acknowledges no prior knowledge in the domain
2. **Active Learning**: Asks clarifying questions and seeks understanding
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies connections to existing knowledge
4. **Integration**: Builds comprehensive domain understanding
5. **Application**: Demonstrates learning through practical examples
